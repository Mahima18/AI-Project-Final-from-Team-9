Attatched Files :

1.Pre_Processing_&_Feature_Extraction.ipynb - Pre processing of dataset videos into frames to label them and to extract suitable features for our classification model based on the facial landmarks that we extracted from the frames of the videos.

2.Normalization.ipynb - To normalize the features of each individual, we took the first three frames for each individualâ€™s alert video and used them as the baseline for normalization.

3.Classification_Models.ipynb - Basic classification models and other deep learning approaches.

4.LSTM.ipynb - LSTM networks are a special kind of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), capable of learning long-term dependencies in the data.

5.Main_Code.ipynb -Implementing the model to predict new frames as alert or drowsy.
