Attatched Files :

1.Feature Extraction.ipynb - Suitable features for our classification model based on the facial landmarks that we extracted from the frames of the videos.

2.Normalization.ipynb - To normalize the features of each individual, we took the first three frames for each individualâ€™s alert video and used them as the baseline for normalization.

3.Classification Models.ipynb - Basic classification models and other deep learning approaches.

4.LSTM.ipynb - LSTM networks are a special kind of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), capable of learning long-term dependencies in the data.

5.VGG16.ipynb - Transfer learning focuses on using the knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to solve a different but related problem .The model we decided to use is VGG16 with the Imagenet dataset.
